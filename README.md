[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contact-App-<COLOR>.svg)](https://github.com/<valijonboy>/contact-app)


## Overview

The Contact App is an Android application built with Jetpack Compose, following the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture pattern. It leverages Dagger Hilt for Dependency Injection, Room for local data persistence, Coroutine Flow for asynchronous data processing, and Clean Architecture principles to achieve a modular and maintainable codebase.

The primary goal of the Contact App is to provide users with an intuitive and seamless experience for managing their contacts. The app allows users to add, edit, and delete contacts, view contact details.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose UI**: The Contact App is developed entirely using Jetpack Compose, the declarative UI toolkit by Google, providing a modern and efficient user interface.

- **Model-View-Intent (MVI) Architecture**: The app follows the MVI architecture pattern, ensuring separation of concerns and facilitating state management.

- **Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt**: Dagger Hilt is utilized to manage dependencies and promote code reusability through dependency injection.

- **Room Database**: The app employs Room, a robust persistence library, to store contacts locally and ensure seamless data management.

- **Asynchronous Operations with Coroutine Flow**: Coroutine Flow is employed for handling asynchronous operations, such as fetching and saving contact data efficiently.

- **Clean Architecture and Multi-Module Structure**: The app adopts Clean Architecture principles, dividing the project into multiple modules, simplifying code navigation, and enhancing code organization.

## Modules

The project is structured into the following modules:

- **app**: The main module that contains the Jetpack Compose UI, ViewModels, and navigation logic.
- **data**: The data layer module responsible for providing data to the app, including data sources, repositories, and data models.
- **domain**: The domain layer module that holds the business logic and use cases.

## Installation
